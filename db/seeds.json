    "body": "I took my wife and 3 sons on a beautiful hike at Big Meadows, which is off of Skyline Drive in the George Washington National Forest.  It cost about $15 to get into the park, and it was about a 30 minute drive to get to the meadows from the entrance of the park.  We were even able to bring a stroller on the trail, which was great because the hike was pretty long so when one of our sons got tired we could put him in the stoller for a bit.",
