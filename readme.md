About:

This app is a conceptual project and just putting some skin on an idea
I had to create an app that helps people find things to do in their area
when they are fresh out of ideas.  It would be populated with user generated
content and could pull in external API's like Google Places as an added feature.

What Would I Do Next?

-Find relevant external API's to add in
-Add geo searching
-Add tags to posts
-User Auth
-Give each post a rating or upvotes
-Allow users to share on Facebook
